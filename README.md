# Javscript_Code_Quiz

For this project we were tasked with creating a Javascript code quiz that would ask the user multiple choice questions and run a 60 second timer. If the user selected a wrong answer they are penalized by having 10 seconds deducted from the timer. If the timer reaches zero the quiz is over. Once the user gets through all the questions they have the ability to submit their initials and the time amount that they had left on the clock.


The quiz starts off with a fairly simple opening screen. You see a welcome message and a large green start button.

Once you click this start button, the quiz begins. The user is shown a total of three multiple choice questions for the whole quiz and you will see the timer running in the top right.

After the user finishes the quiz they are met with an input box where they enter their initials and the seconds remaining on the clock when they finished. Once they hit enter this value is commited to local storage and also displayed in a list on the screen.
